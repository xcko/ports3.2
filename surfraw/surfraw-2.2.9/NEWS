          http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html

    Use surfraw-update-path to add this directory to your path or
    prefix elvi with sr or surfraw, eg "sr google foo bar".

    Bookmarks can be defined in /etc/surfraw.bookmarks or
    ~/.surfraw.bookmarks. See /etc/surfraw.bookmarks for the format.
    Bookmarks can be used with "sr [options] bookmarkname".

    There is now a test suite. "make test" to run it or
    see test/README.

    For a full list of changes since the last release, see
    debian/changelog. From this release onwards, changes will be

Please note that the elvi have moved again, to /usr/lib/surfraw

If you used surfraw-update-path from version 2.0 to add the elvi
directory to your path, you will need to run it again, first with
